# Coding-Projects
Highschool coding projects
This repository contains a few notable coding projects I have created during my grade 10-12 computer science classes. 

Pygame Summative folder contains a combination of two computer games coded using python. I wrote this along with my friend. The folder includes pictures, music files, and score txt files that are essential to game execution.
